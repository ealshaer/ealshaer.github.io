    <h2>Students' Testimony</h2>
    <div class="project">
    <p>I have been always blessed by working with smart, dedicated and hardworking students for the past years of my career. My research group has been very productive producing innovative research publishing many papers in high tier conferences and reputable venues. I am proud of their accomplishment during the PhD and during their career afterwards. Many of them got good satisfying jobs months in academia and industry many months before their dissertation defense.</p>
    <p>I took the PhD advising/supervising role very seriously; and known of my dedication and support to my students. We always maintain professional and caring relationship that goes beyond the research and publication business. As a result, I put a significant effort in guiding and mentoring my PhD students, which always reflected very well on the students performance and success. My goal is to train my students to be highly innovative, strongly competitive, and caring to contribute to society.</p>
    <p>For all my students, and particularly those who expressed their warm feelings and support, I will always value your genuine effort, appreciate the great time we spent together, and always looking forward to supporting you in your forthcoming professional and personal life. So please keep in touch.</p>
    <p>Finally, special appreciation of those how sent me emails expressing their experience and gratitude, and the anonymous comments forwarded to me during/after the course of your PhD. I highly value your comments and feedback, and I am glad to share it publicly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dr. Al-Shaer has deep knowledge, interest, and passion towards research and student supervision that sets a high standard for exemplary advisor and mentor. His mentoring and discussing has shaped my skills and success career as an assistant professor.</li>
      <li>I gained a lot of knowledge and experience working under his supervision on both the academic and personal levels. He strives to always be up to date with new and innovative research and technologies in the field, which has helped me tremendously to produce novel and quality research inspired by real-life problems and solutions.</li>
      <li>Dr. Ehab: I learn a lot from you; one thing is to except not less than perfectness in my work. I learned how to aim high and how to work hard to achieve my goals.</li>
      <li>His humbleness, open-minded style in discussion, unlimited patience had always encouraged me to work hard persistently and respect your feedback. If I am right, he acknowledge it in very positive way. Otherwise, he starts asking me questions to make me understand the flaws in my works.</li>
      <li>I highly appreciate his tremendous encouragement even when I made little or no progress. I never saw him frustrated or upset despite the numerous backtracking in research discussion. This in my mind one of the greatest character that makes me feel safe, comfortable and motivated. Thank you for making me feel safe by your understanding, and caring.</li>
      <li>Dr Ehab is very enthusiastic and energetic. He is welcoming to discuss with students hours and hours about research topics, never get bored. We found his door always open for us to discuss anything.</li>
      <li>Dr Ehab provides a significant support/feedback for us because he is always up to date with the recent development in the field and the future exciting directions.</li>
      <li>He always push us to our peak to get the best outcome. This can be challenging sometimes but this definitely good for us to be competitive and successful in our career.</li>
      <li>If you do not know what good quality research is, you will not be able to accomplish it. Thank you, Professor Al-Shaer! You guided me to perform high quality research.</li>
      <li>Professor Al-Shaer had the overwhelming capability of critically analyzing a research work either the problem or its solution.  This capability helped me a lot going in the right direction, and be successful.</li>
      <li>I enjoy doing brainstorming with Dr. Ehab about research problems, new ideas and solutions, where we debate the right approaches.</li>
      <li>He is a very knowledgeable person and helps his students to dive deep into the core of the research. Moreover, he is very patient in listening to our opinions and reasoning that he appreciates a lot. He always helps me to identify flaws in my thinking in a very constructive way.</li>
      <li>One of the perks of working with Dr. Ehab is that he is a very ambitious guy and gave me the opportunity to explore a specific research area, even though it took a long time for becoming matured. Throughout this time, he listened very carefully about my approach, gave ideas about new approaches, and supervised me with appropriate state-of-the-art.</li>
      <li>After many years in my PhD, I can say it is really hard to get a PhD advisor like Dr. Ehab who not only gives problems to students but also works with them to discover or design solutions. Throughout my PhD, he works with me and helps me with ideas whenever I get stuck in a problem.</li>
      <li>Dr. Ehab cares about his students. In my PhD life, whenever I face a problem regarding academic or personal, I ran to him. He always gives his best effort to understand the problems or situations and compromises whenever required. He is very enthusiastic about research and motivates me a lot to do something significantly contributing.</li>
      <li>During my many interactions with Dr. Alshaer, Ive witnessed many of his good traits and virtues. The most of which may be his caring and kindness in the official and personal level towards his advisees.</li>
      <li>I remember that I once needed to move from one place to another and I could not secure a moving truck on time for the move and he offered me his personal van to make the move.</li>
      <li>As an advisor and a team leader and despite his busy scheduled, Dr. Alshaer, always tried to ensure a healthy work environment and tighten the personal relations between the team members by running occasional fund outdoor activities (BBQ, tennis, volley ball etc).</li>
      <li>We as a team under his supervision had always been on good terms with each other and we have been treated fairly and with respect. I have never felt that other members, even the seniors, get any workload or financial privileges over me or other members in the team.</li>
      <li>Dr. Alshaers interest and passion towards research in network and system security has been a great inspiration to me to continue this field during my Ph.D. study and beyond.</li>
      <li> Dr. - AlShaer has also been very helpful during my job hunt after graduating by contacting and recommending me to his professional connections in other schools. As far as I know, this has also been the case with my senior colleagues who graduate before me because he has always been concerned about the success of his students. Ive always looked at Dr. Alshaer not only a successful researcher in his field, but also an intelligent and exemplary mentor in this field. He strives to always be up to date with new and innovative research and technologies in the field, which helped me personally in producing quality and novel research that is inspired by real-life problems and addresses key industry needs.</li>
      <li>I was impressed with Dr. Al-Shaer humbleness especially when I see him interacting with my junior colleagues who usually have a very limited experience in research. He is always respectful for any comments, gentle in in his criticism and instruction.</li>
